<h3 align="left">A Passionate Frontend Developer</h3>
<br>
I am a student at Microverse, an online, immersive, full-time and part-time coding school that offers a remote software development program. My goal is to become a professional software developer, and I am working hard to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to achieve that goal.

<h2>ðŸ”­ Current Status <br></h2>
I am currently learning Web Development at Microverse, where I am expanding my technical and soft skills.

 
<h2>ðŸŒ± Learning <br></h2>
As a developer, I believe that learning is a lifelong process, and I'm constantly exploring new technologies and frameworks to improve my skills. Currently, I'm focusing on Javascript.

 
<h2>ðŸ’¬ Ask me about <br></h2>
If you have any questions related to HTML, CSS and JavaScript feel free to ask me. I'm always happy to help and share my knowledge.
